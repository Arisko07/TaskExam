## Yote

Find Your Road.

### Installing Yote

 This is an internal tool we use at [Fugitive Labs](www.fugitivelabs.com). It has an accompanying [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yote) to make getting projects up and running easier, which you can install via npm. It is under active developement, but feel free to try it out and contribute!

To install React with npm, run:

```bash
sudo npm install -g yote
```

To create a new application ``` $ yote create projectName ```

To create a new resource ``` $ yote gen resourceName ```
