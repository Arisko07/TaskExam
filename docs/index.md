Welcome to Yote!
======

Yote is the best super-stack solution out there for any data-driven application.  

> **WTF is a super-stack solution?**  Glad you asked.  A 'super-stack' is a made up term for a solution that provides a web application, native mobile apps, and api services out of the box.

## Philosophy

Client-agnostic services and server-agnostic clients that are **FAST**, **FLEXIBLE**, and **POWERFUL**.

Our idea is to take the best practices of the best frameworks and services available and package them up together in one place to help developers roll out production ready solutions as quickly and painlessly as possible.  

Right now the stack looks like this (from back to front):

#### Server
* [Mongo]()
* [Mongoose]()
* [Node]()
* [Express]()
* [Passport]()
* [Docker]() _deployment_

#### Client
* [React]()
* [React-Router]()
* [Redux]()

#### Mobile
* [React Native]()
* [Redux]()

We're not married to it (we used to use Angular on the client). But we think this is the most comprehensive stack available right now. 

* * *
- [Getting Started](./getting-started)
- [Client](./client/)
- [Server](./server/)
- [Mobile](./mobile/)
