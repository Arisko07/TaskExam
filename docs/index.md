Welcome to Yote!
======

Yote is the best super-stack solution out there for any data-driven application.  

> **WTF is a super-stack solution?**  Glad you asked.  A 'super-stack' is a made up term for a solution that provides a web application, native mobile apps, and api services out of the box.

## Philosophy

Our idea is to take the best practices of the best frameworks and services available and package them up together in one place to help developers roll out production ready solutions as quickly and painlessly as possible.  

Right now the Yote stack looks like this:

#### Database
* [Mongo](http://www.mongodb.org/)
* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)

#### Server/API
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
* [Passport](http://passportjs.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 

#### Client
* [React](https://reactjs.com/)
* [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

#### Mobile
* [React Native](http://www.reactnative.com/)
* [Redux again](https://redux.js.org/)

We're not married to it, but we think this is the most comprehensive stack available.

Yote may change the nuts and bolts from time to time &mdash; hell, we used to use Angular as the default client &mdash; but the general philosophy will remain the same: Yote will always provide client-agnostic services and server-agnostics clients that are **FAST**, **FLEXIBLE**, and **POWERFUL** out of the box.
