Find Your Road.

# Formatted README below

_NOTE:  This is an internal tool we use at [Fugitive Labs](www.fugitivelabs.com). It has an accompanying [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yote) to make getting projects up and running easier, which you can install via npm. It is under active development, but feel free to try it out and contribute!  _
